Explanation of Selected Options

    User Information:
        Setting GIT_NAME and GIT_EMAIL ensures your commits are attributed to you correctly.

    Editor Configuration:
        GIT_EDITOR="code --wait" sets Visual Studio Code as your default Git editor.
        You can change this to your preferred editor, such as "vim" or "nano".

    Git Output and Line Endings:
        Enabling colored output improves readability of Git commands.
        Setting line endings to "unix" is common for macOS/Linux systems.
        If you're on Windows, you might set LINE_END_CHOICE="windows".

    Git Behavior and Aliases:
        Setting push.default to "simple" makes git push behavior more intuitive.
        Common Git aliases are defined to speed up your workflow.

    Global .gitignore:
        A global .gitignore file helps you avoid committing unnecessary files across all repositories.
        Common patterns are added by default, and you can customize it further.

    Merge Tool Configuration:
        Setting a merge tool like meld helps resolve merge conflicts visually.
        If you prefer a different tool, adjust MERGE_TOOL_CHOICE.

    Git Performance Optimization:
        Enabling performance optimizations can speed up operations in large repositories.

    Credential Helper:
        Using a credential helper like "cache" allows Git to remember your credentials for a certain period.
        On macOS, you might use "osxkeychain", and on Windows, "wincred".

    Rebase Auto Stash and Git Pager:
        Enabling auto stash during rebases prevents conflicts with local changes.
        Customizing Git's pager enhances the display of command outputs like git log.

    Commit Message Template:
        A commit template provides a consistent structure for your commit messages.
        You can edit the template file to suit your project's needs.

    SSH Key Generation:
        Generating an SSH key allows you to authenticate with Git servers securely.
        Using ed25519 is recommended for stronger security with shorter keys.

    Additional Software Packages:
        Including "git-lfs" installs Git Large File Storage support, useful if you work with large files.

    Logging and Dry-Run Mode:
        Enabling logging helps you review what the script did.
        Dry-run mode is set to "no" to allow the script to make changes. Set to "yes" if you want to simulate the actions first.

    Non-Interactive Mode:
        Set to "yes" since you're using a configuration file and don't want interactive prompts.
