- 2GB minimum available RAM
- 20GB minimum free disk space
- Host system supporting virtualization

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kyleorman/TruVium.git
   cd TruVium
   ```

2. **Start the Environment**
   ```bash
   vagrant up
   ```

3. **Connect to the Environment**
   ```bash
   vagrant ssh
   ```

Additonal host terminal commands

**Reload the Environment**
- If you want to force a restart or boot up the environment if it was off (e.g. after the host machine is rebooted)
   ```bash
   vagrant reload
   ```
**Stop the Environment**
   ```bash
   vagrant halt
   ```

**Destroy the Environment**
warning - configurations made after the instance was created will be lost and you will have to spin up a new instance 
   ```bash
   vagrant destroy
   ```

## Usage Notes

### Operating System
- The default configuration uses Arch Linux for the most up to date software versions
- Uses the pacman package manager (sudo pacman -S <package>)
- Access to community provided AUR packages available via yay (yay -S <package>)

## Configuration

### Host Configuration
- Apple Silicon may need a workaround since only the most recent version of VirtualBox is supported and Vagrant doesn't recognize it as an option yet
- Host terminal configuration can affect some keybindings, colors, and fonts. Using a NerdFont like FiraCode Mono for powerline symbol support is suggested. Additionally, Alacritty is a good cross-platform terminal, but a separate X-server is needed and may require configuration if you are running on Windows or macOS.

### Vagrant Configuration (`vagrant_config.json`)
- Default configuration sets vm_cpus and vm_memory to relatively low values
- If your host computer can support higher settings, they can be set in `vagrant_config.json` -- this may improve setup time and user experience
- Setup time may also be improved by commenting out unnecessary installs within `vagrant_setup_arch.sh` in `/TruVium/vagrant-scripts`

```json
{
  "vm_box": "archlinux/archlinux",
  "vm_box_version": "20241001.267073",
  "box_check_update": true,
  "vm_hostname": "dev-env",
  "vm_memory": "4096", # 4GB RAM allocation
  "vm_cpus": 4,
  "vb_gui": false,
  "graphics_controller": "Vboxsvga",
  "primary_disk_size": "20GB",
}
```

### Git Profile Setup
- Fill out `git_setup_example.conf` in `/TruVium/templates`, rename file to git_setup.conf, and place in the `/TruVium/vagrant-config` directory
- It will be applied during `vagrant up`
- Alternatively, run with command:
  ```bash
  ./git_setup.sh --config-file git_setup.conf --non-interactive
  ```
  in the `/vagrant/vagrant-scripts` within the VM
- You may also run the script directly:
  ```bash
  ./git_setup.sh
  ```
  and choose options interactively
- The setup script works on host computers with Chocolatey (Windows), Homebrew (macOS), or natively on most Linux distributions

### Port Forwarding
- To enable Jupyter Notebook access edit `vagrant_config.json` like so:
```json
{
  "forward_jupyter_port": true,
  "port_forwarding": [
    { "guest": 8888, "host": 8888 }
}
```
- Run the following in the VM and the Jupyter Notebook will be available in your host OS's browser at `http://localhost:8888/`:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888 --ip=0.0.0.0
  ```
- Additional ports can be configured in `vagrant_config.json`

### X11 Forwarding
- Enabled by default for graphical applications like GTKWave
- Windows and macOS users must run an X-server (e.g., MobaXterm, Xming) for GUI applications
- X11 forwarding is unnecessary if you set up a desktop environment through the VM GUI

### tmux Configuration
- Prefix key is set to `Ctrl-a` by default
> **Note**: May conflict with host OS keybinds and can be adjusted in tmux configuration.
- Notable hotkeys:
  - `Alt-f`: Use FZF to control tmux
  - `Alt-t`: Use tmux-sessionizer to create persistent project based sessions
  - `Alt-\`: Use floating window
  > **Note**: Commands that don't us the Prefix key may conflict with host terminal keybinds.
  - `<PREFIX>s`: Create vertical split
  - `<PREFIX>d`: Create horizontal split
- Configuration location:
  - Local: `~/.tmux.conf` within the VM
  - Persistent: `/TruVium/user-config/tmux.conf` for changes between VM rebuilds

### Vim Configuration
- Plugins can be added/removed by modifying the `vagrant_setup.sh` or `vagrant_setup_arch.sh` scripts in `/TruVium/vagrant-scripts`
- `<leader>` key is mapped to `,` for custom commands
- Notable hotkeys:
  - `<C-e>`: Toggle NERDTree file explorer
  - `<leader>fv`: Autoformat VHDL code
  - `s` + two chars: EasyMotion navigation
  - `<C-p>`: Fuzzy find files
- GitHub Copilot:
  - Setup: Run `:Copilot setup` within Vim
  - Accept suggestions: `<leader>Tab` (Tab key alone may conflict with other completions)
- Configuration locations:
  - Local: `~/.vimrc` within the VM
  - Persistent: `/TruVium/user-config/vimrc` for changes between VM rebuilds
- To quit Vim `:q` or `:q!` 😉

### Vim/tmux Integration
- Seamless navigation between Vim splits and tmux panes using:
  - `<C-H>`: Move Left
  - `<C-J>`: Move Down
  - `<C-K>`: Move Up
  - `<C-L>`: Move Right
  or
  - `<S-Left Arrow>`: Move Left
  - `<S-Down Arrow>`: Move Down
  - `<S-Up Arrow>`: Move Up
  - `<S-Right Arrow>`: Move Right
- Note: Navigation may behave differently in NeoVim, Doom Emacs, or other software

### Adding Custom Tools
1. Modify the setup script:
   ```bash
   # For Arch Linux
   vagrant_setup_arch.sh
   ```
2. Add installation commands
3. Apply changes:
   ```bash
   vagrant provision
   ```

### Editor Configuration
### Editor Configuration
- **Vim**: Configuration in `~/.vimrc`
- **Neovim**: Configuration in `~/.config/nvim`
- **Emacs**: Configuration in `~/.doom.d/config.el`

## Additional Documentation

- [Desktop Environment Setup Guide](docs/desktop_environment_setup.md): Instructions for configuring desktop environments and session managers in the TruVium Vagrant VM.
> **Note**: This guide provides additional configurations for desktop environments within the TruVium Vagrant VM. Not all configurations are thoroughly tested, as TruVium's primary focus is on CLI-based HDL development.
- [Custom Keybindings](docs/custom_keybinds.md): A work-in-progress list of all configured keybindings, organized by tool for easy reference and future updates.
> **Note**: Some keybindings may require adjustment based on host terminal or OS configuration.

## Common Tasks

### Environment Management
```bash
# Update environment with new configurations
vagrant provision

# Completely rebuild environment
vagrant destroy
vagrant up

# Access the development environment
vagrant ssh
```

### Editor Commands
```bash

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Memory Issues**
   - Reduce `vm_memory` in `vagrant_config.json` if host system is constrained
   - Close resource-intensive applications before starting VM
   - Monitor memory usage with `htop` inside VM

2. **Port Conflicts**
   - Check for port conflicts: `netstat -tuln` on host
   - Modify port forwarding settings in `vagrant_config.json`
   - Ensure no other services are using required ports

3. **Graphics Issues**
   - Adjust `graphics_controller` in `vagrant_config.json`
   - Update VirtualBox to latest stable version
   - Verify X11 server configuration (Windows/macOS)

### Logs and Debugging
- **Detailed Vagrant Logs**:
  ```bash
  vagrant up --debug > vagrant.log 2>&1
  ```
- **Setup Logs**: Available at `/var/log/setup-script.log` inside VM
- **Real-time Log Monitoring**:
  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/setup-script.log
  ```
